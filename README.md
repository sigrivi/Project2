# Project2

project2b_py.alt builds a discretization matrix suitable for the one particle case, and has an eigenvalue solver which uses Jacobi's method to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors. It plots the three lowest solutions. 

project2_unittests.py are unit tests for project2b_alt.py

project2d.py builds a discretization matrix suitable for the two particle case, here omega_r is a parameter you can vary. It plots the solution of the eigenvalue problem for different omegas. 

project2_benchmark.txt contains benchmark calculations. 

project2b.py finds only eigenvalues
project2c.py are unit tests of project2b.py
